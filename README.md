This project was created as part of our Computer Organization and Assembly Language course during our third semester.

Description: It is a Word Hunt game that allows the user to search for words in all four directions. If the word is found, it increases the score; otherwise, it decreases the score. When the user decides to exit the program, it writes the score to the score.txt file.

How you can access it: Clone the repository. Execute the assembly file.

Contributions: We welcome contributions via pull requests.
